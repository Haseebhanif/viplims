Blood tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. ... Specifically, blood tests can help doctors: Evaluate how well organs—such as the kidneys, liver, thyroid, and heart—are working. Diagnose diseases and conditions such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, anemia (uh-NEE-me-eh), and coronary heart disease.



Clinical Details

The accuracy of test results is dependent on the integrity of specimens. ... (See Blood Specimens: Chemistry and Hematology − Preparing Serum on clotting .... should be explained in detail, particularly to aged or overanxious patients or their



Macroscopic Details

When applied to physical phenomena and bodies, the macroscopic scale describes things as a person can directly perceive them, without the aid of magnifying devices. This is in contrast to observations (microscopy) or theories (microphysics, statistical physics) of objects of geometric lengths smaller than perhaps some hundreds of micrometers.  A macroscopic view of a ball is just that: a ball. A microscopic view could reveal a thick round skin seemingly composed entirely of puckered cracks and fissures (as viewed through a microscope) or, further down in scale, a collection of molecules in a roughly spherical shape. An example of a physical theory that takes a deliberately macroscopic viewpoint is thermodynamics. An example of a topic that extends from macroscopic to microscopic viewpoints is histology.
